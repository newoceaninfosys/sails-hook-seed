sails-hook-seed
====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lykmapipo/sails-hook-seed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lykmapipo/sails-hook-seed)


DRY data seeding for sails.

Simplify seeding data to your persistent storage of your choice based on the current running environment obtained from `sails.config.environment` of your application. You may use `sails-hook-seed` during `test`, `development` and even seed your application with default data during deployment in `production` environment.

*Note: This requires Sails v0.11.0+.  If v0.11.0+ isn't published to NPM yet, you'll need to install it via Github.*

## Installation
```js
$ npm install --save sails-hook-seed
```

*You may opt to install [Faker](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) as your test and development seed generator*
```js
$ npm install --save-dev faker
```

## Usage
By default `sails-hook-seed` look for environment specific seeds in the `seeds` directory inside `sails.appPath` of your application. Example, if you need to seed your application during `test` you will have to create `seeds/test` and add `model seed files` inside it.

`sails-hook-seed` will load any file suffix-ed with `Seed` as a seed. Example, if you want to seed your `User` model during `test` your need to write your seed as folow:

```js
//in seed/test/UserSeed.js
var faker = require('faker');

//array of plain object
//to seed in User model
module.exports = [{
    username: faker.internet.userName(),
    email: faker.internet.email()
}];
```

## Seed Types
`sails-hook-seed` accept `array type`, `plain object` and `functional` type seeds.

#### Object Seed Type
```js
//in seed/test/UserSeed.js
var faker = require('faker');

//object to seed
//in User model
module.exports = {
    username: faker.internet.userName(),
    email: faker.internet.email()
};
```

#### Array Seed Type
```js
//in seed/test/UserSeed.js
var faker = require('faker');

//array of data to seed
module.exports = [{
    username: faker.internet.userName(),
    email: faker.internet.email()
}];
```

#### Functional Seed Type
```js
//in seed/test/UserSeed.js
var faker = require('faker');

//function to be evaluated to obtain data
module.exports = function(done) {

    var data = [{
        username: faker.internet.userName(),
        email: faker.internet.email()
    }, {
        username: faker.internet.userName(),
        email: faker.internet.email()
    }];

    //remember to tell when your are done
    done(null, data);
};
```


The same convection must be followed for `development` and `production` environment.

*Note: Environement specific folder are named after their environment name, e.g if `sails.config.environment` is `test`, then to make sure your test seeds are loaded they must be placed under `seed/test` folder for `sails-hook-seed` to pick and apply your seeds. Your may look this repo `seeds folder` to see example*

## Configuration
`sails-hook-seed` accept application defined configuration by utilizing sails configuration api. In sails `config` directory add `config/seed.js` and you will be able to override all the defauts configurations.

Simply, copy the below and add it to your `config/seed.js`
```js
module.exports.seed = {
    //directory where migration resides
    //relative to `sails.appPath`
    path: 'seeds',

    //enable or disable seeding
    active: true,

    // extra paths
    extraPaths: [
        'themes/abc/seeds'
    ]
}
```

## Testing

* Install `grunt-cli` global

```sh
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

* Install all development dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

* Then run test

```sh
$ npm test
```
